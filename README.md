# stock-portfolio-suggestion-web-app

A stock portfolio suggestion web application using Python's Flask web framework.

## Prerequisites

* Linux, Mac, or Windows machine
* Python (Python 3.5.2 was used for this project)
* Flask web framework

## Getting Started

## Running the Application

The Flask application is ran with a localhost server (IP address 127.0.0.1). Network servers usually listen for
connections on a specific port number. Because this application is running in a developmental environment, Flask uses
the freely available port 5000. 

Flask first needs to be told how to import the application, by setting the ```FLASK_APP``` environmental variable:

```
(venv) $ export FLASK_APP=stock-portfolio-suggestion-web-app.py
```

On Microsoft Windows, use ```set``` instead of ```export``` in the command above.

You can now run the application with the following command:

```
(venv) $ flask run
 * Serving Flask app "app"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
